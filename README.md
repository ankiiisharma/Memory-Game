# Memory-Game
A classic memory game where players match pairs of cards to clear the board.

# Gameplay
The game starts with all cards face down.
Players take turns clicking on two cards to reveal them.
If the two cards match, they remain face up and the player gets a point.
If the two cards don't match, they are flipped back face down and the next player's turn starts.
The game continues until all cards are matched.
